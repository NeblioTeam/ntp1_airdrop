# ntp1_airdrop

This repository has been forked from the excellent work done by the Trifid Team. It has been updated, optimized, and new features have been added to make it easier to airdrop NTP1 tokens to Neblio addresses. 

**If this script helped you successfully execute an NTP1 airdrop, please consider donating to the Trifid Team at the address below.**

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/NeblioTeam/ntp1_airdrop.git`

2. Run the following commands:

  * `cd ntp1_airdrop`

  * `npm install request-promise`

  * `npm install git://github.com/NeblioTeam/bitcoinjs-lib.git#nebliojs-lib`


3. Rename `secrets.json.template` to `secrets.json`. Set up the `secrets.json` and `snapshot.csv` files as below:

  * secrets.json
  ```
  {
      "from_address": "<>",
      "private_key": "<>",
      "token_id": "<>",
      "network": "mainnet",
      "debug": false
  }
  ```

Note: from_address and private_key refer to the address you are sending the NTP1 tokens from.

* snapshot.csv
```
    address,amount
    add1,amt1
    add2,amt2
    etc.,etc.
```

Note: The example snapshot.csv included in this repo was generated by the Neblio Team at block height 2143965 on testnet. Balances below 5 and above 1 million have been excluded. 

**If you need help generating a snapshot, [contact us](https://nebl.io/contact-us/).**

4. Run `python addressChecker.py`. This will use Neblio's insight API to check that all addresses on the list are valid. At the end of running it will print out a list of valid addresses in the snapshot.csv format, as well as a list of invalid addresses. The valid list can be copy & pasted into snapshot.csv to clear out any invalid addresses.
```
$ python addressChecker.py
Network: testnet
Debug: False
--------
Address: TFJm3hpdsUMyn6feoDXopNes71Q9NZqYBG: 135.9933
Address: TSm7iFVrx55gQR6hxtchwopcUDt531UN7a: 0.0072
Address: TDswpA5DuSrwTnH3C2Ytj2f6ewYMXAEHct: 0.0072
...
Address: TY4HbBuHY22WaUg6BwJxMJbe5t5Q6SBBk9: 0.0018
Address: TE5Jt57Ya624xGSXVqwqoKMde4tJNiTVye: 0.003

----VALID LIST----
address,amount
TFJm3hpdsUMyn6feoDXopNes71Q9NZqYBG,10
TSm7iFVrx55gQR6hxtchwopcUDt531UN7a,11
TDswpA5DuSrwTnH3C2Ytj2f6ewYMXAEHct,12
...
TY4HbBuHY22WaUg6BwJxMJbe5t5Q6SBBk9,1
TE5Jt57Ya624xGSXVqwqoKMde4tJNiTVye,32
```

5. Once you are sure all addresses are valid, Run `node ntp1_airdrop.js`. This will use Neblio's APIs to broadcast 25 send_token requests at a time and pause to wait for 1 block confirmation before proceeding to the next 25.
